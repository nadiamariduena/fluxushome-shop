##### IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO VISUALIZE THE PROJECT with NPM START

- IF the error is related to the binding

- DELETE the node modules and the package lock json and proceed to type npm install again, so to install all the dependencies and get a new node modules

### ANIMATION üèÉ

##### I REPLACED THE ANIMATION

- I am still not glad with it but i think i am going to leave like so for this project, as i will be focused more in the backend.

```css
/************* BEFORE **************/
  background-image: url(../img-decor/ignant-design-ligne-roset-daybed-001--720x325.jpg);
  background-position: center right;
  background-size: 150%;
  transition: 6s ease;
 &:hover {
    background-position: left bottom;
    background-size: 110%;
    background-image: url(../img-decor/OS---OOS_private-residence-3.jpg);


/************* AFTER **************/
.home-banner {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop5_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
  background-position: right bottom 14%;
  background-size: cover;
  animation-delay: -2s;
  animation: mymove 9s infinite alternate-reverse ease-in-out;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  position: relative;

  // &:hover {
  //   background-position: right bottom 14%;
  //   background-size: cover;
  //   background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop3_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
  // }

  @keyframes mymove {
    0% {
      background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop5_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
    }
    25% {
      background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop4_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
    }
    50% {
      background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop10_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
    }
    100% {
      background-image: url(../img-shop/frontshop11_by_Tr√¨nh-Minh-Th∆∞.jpg);
